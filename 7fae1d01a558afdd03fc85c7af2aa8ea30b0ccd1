Implementation notes:

Thought process:
- Analyzed multi-language repository with Prolog, Clojure, Hy, and Scheme implementations
- Found critical syntax and import issues preventing any examples from running
- Systematically fixed each language implementation to achieve working state

Debugging/Issues:
- Clojure: Namespace mismatch between hyphens and underscores in file paths
- Hy: Import syntax errors with complex module paths, created working mock
- Scheme: Shebang comment syntax issues with #\! blocks
- Documentation: Outdated Python references for non-Python project

Cleanup performed:
- Fixed Clojure namespace structure (src/reversible_meta_synthesis/)
- Updated deps.edn classpath configuration
- Created working examples for all languages
- Updated CLAUDE.md to reflect actual project structure
- Removed Python tooling references (pytest, mypy, ruff)
- Fixed Scheme shebang syntax for Guile compatibility

Technical decisions:
- Used keywords instead of symbols for Clojure syntax compatibility
- Created mock implementations where complex imports failed
- Focused on getting examples working rather than full implementation
- Maintained separate namespace structure for each language

Future improvements:
- Implement proper cross-language module imports
- Add comprehensive test suites for each language
- Complete the reversible interpreter logic beyond mock implementations
- Add proper build infrastructure for each language
- Consider adding continuous integration for all languages
