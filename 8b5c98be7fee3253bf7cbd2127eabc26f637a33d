Context: Development Environment Setup
=======================================

Timing: 2025-08-06 (Implementation time: ~5 minutes)

Purpose:
--------
Set up a comprehensive development environment for the reversible-meta-synthesis
project with focus on Scheme development support and tmux session management.

Key Considerations:
------------------
1. Multi-language support: The project implements reversible meta-interpreters
   in Clojure, Hy, Scheme, and Prolog, requiring flexible tooling.

2. Emacs configuration: Chose Geiser for Scheme REPL integration as it provides
   excellent Guile support with debugging and evaluation capabilities.

3. Tmux session management: Provides persistent development sessions with
   multiple windows for editor, REPL, and shell access.

4. Environment variables: Centralized in .envrc for direnv compatibility and
   Makefile for traditional make workflows.

Implementation Details:
----------------------
- .envrc: Defines PROJECT_NAME, PROJECT_ROOT, and language-specific paths
- Makefile: Provides targets for dev-env, testing, examples, and session management
- reversible-meta-synthesis.el: Full Emacs configuration with:
  * Geiser for Guile integration
  * Paredit for structural editing
  * Rainbow delimiters for visual clarity
  * Company mode for autocompletion
  * Org-mode with Babel for literate programming
  * TRAMP for remote development
  * Custom key bindings for project tasks
- dev-env.sh: Robust tmux launcher with:
  * Dependency checking
  * Session lifecycle management
  * TTY tracking for pane identification
  * Multiple windows (emacs, repl, shell)

Technical Choices:
-----------------
1. Guile3 as the Scheme implementation (already used in project)
2. Geiser over other Scheme modes for superior REPL integration
3. Tmux for persistent sessions across SSH connections
4. Separate script (dev-env.sh) for flexibility beyond make

Issues Encountered:
------------------
None - all files created successfully and configurations are compatible
with the existing project structure.

Testing Recommendations:
-----------------------
1. Run 'make dev-env' to test tmux session creation
2. Verify Emacs loads with Scheme support
3. Test Geiser REPL connection with C-c r r
4. Confirm TTY tracking with './dev-env.sh info'

Future Enhancements:
-------------------
- Add support for Clojure CIDER mode
- Configure Hy-mode when available
- Add Prolog mode configuration
- Integrate with project's test framework
- Add debugging configurations for each language
