Documentation and testing infrastructure improvements:

Thought process:
- Created comprehensive test runner for all language implementations
- Updated README to reflect actual project structure and working examples
- Provided clear installation and usage instructions for each language

Cleanup performed:
- Added test_all.sh script that tests Clojure, Hy, Scheme, and Prolog
- Updated README.md with accurate directory structure
- Added individual command examples for each language
- Documented all four implementations clearly
- Removed outdated installation script references

Technical decisions:
- Made test script handle missing Prolog gracefully
- Used bash for maximum compatibility
- Provided both unified test runner and individual commands
- Focused on practical usage instructions

Testing results:
- All language implementations now run successfully
- Test script validates the entire project works as expected
- Documentation accurately reflects current state
